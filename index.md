# Livermore Marathi Mandal

Welcome to Livermore Marathi. We are a community of marathi speaking people in Livermore, CA. The intent of this community is to get together and share and celebrate the rich Marathi heritage.

We are still working on putting together a website, however, we do have a [Whatsapp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FsHc7kmJn4s2WRlC9HjXxZ) you can join today. More details will be updated here on activities and events as we progress.

Thank you :)
